has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities, although the threat does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane. the city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, jacksonville has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms crossing the state from the gulf of mexico to the atlantic ocean, or passing to the north or south in the atlantic and brushing past the area. the strongest effect on jacksonville was from hurricane dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the first coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. the eye crossed st. augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong category 2 on the saffir-simpson scale. jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's tropical storm fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of jacksonville under darkness for four days. similarly, four years prior to this, jacksonville was inundated by hurricane frances and hurricane jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. these tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to jacksonville. hurricane floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to jacksonville beach. during floyd, the jacksonville beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. the rebuilt pier was later damaged by fay, but not destroyed. tropical storm bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process. on may 28, 2012, jacksonville was hit by tropical storm beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall near jacksonville beach.\\nduring reconstruction and the gilded age, jacksonville and nearby st. augustine became popular winter resorts for the rich and famous. visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad. president grover cleveland attended the sub-tropical exposition in the city on february 22, 1888 during his trip to florida. this highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism. the city's tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever outbreaks. in addition, extension of the florida east coast railway further south drew visitors to other areas. from 1893 to 1938 jacksonville was the site of the florida old confederate soldiers and sailors home with a nearby cemetery.\\nfrench huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st. johns river in 1562 calling it the river of may because he discovered it in may. ribault erected a stone column near present-day jacksonville claiming the newly discovered land for france. in 1564, rené goulaine de laudonnière established the first european settlement, fort caroline, on the st. johns near the main village of the saturiwa. philip ii of spain ordered pedro menéndez de avilés to protect the interest of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline. on september 20, 1565, a spanish force from the nearby spanish settlement of st. augustine attacked fort caroline, and killed nearly all the french soldiers defending it. the spanish renamed the fort san mateo, and following the ejection of the french, st. augustine's position as the most important settlement in florida was solidified. the location of fort caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of the fort was established on the st. johns river in 1964.\\nthe

of fort caroline on the banks of the st. johns river in what is today jacksonville, florida. the effort was the first at any permanent european settlement in the present-day continental united states, but survived only a short time. a september 1565 french naval attack against the new spanish colony at st. augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the spanish encampment at fort matanzas. hundreds of french soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior spanish forces led by pedro menendez. menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless
